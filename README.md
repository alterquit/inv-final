# inv-final
A inventory management program based on python tkinter.
Our program is an inventory management system, The program imports a sql database, allowing users to call or store data.

In this project, there are currently two types of user permissions:
  1. Users
  2. Administrator

Both administrators and users log in through the login page. New users can use the registration function to create accounts. The user's account number is stored in the database.

  -Administrator account:    admin
  -Administrator password:   admin

users can see the Overview and Search & Configuration buttons after entering the main page of the program. Click Overview to see an overview of inventory, or Search & Configuration to find or modify inventory data

Administrators have more User management than users and the ability to export visual data. The administrator User management function allows you to delete user accounts stored in the database. Visual data feature (to be improved) allows administrators to export information from databases in the form of statistical graphs.
